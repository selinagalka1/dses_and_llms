    "This script facilitates semi-automatic named entity recognition (NER) in TEI/XML-encoded historical French texts using the large language model Claude. It operates in two main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotation Phase: The script loads a TEI-encoded XML file, extracts each paragraph (\\<p> element), and submits it to Claude via a few-shot-prompt. The prompt instructs the model to identify and wrap only person and place names using \\<persName> and \\<placeName>, while preserving all other existing XML tags. The output is validated for structural correctness and reintegrated into the TEI document, which is then saved with annotated entities."
